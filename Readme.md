### Predicting Emergency Department Outcomes with MIMICIV (MIMICEL) Data
This project is to use XD2_Net architecture (an explainable deep learning architecture) to predict two outcomes in the emergency department

** LOS - Patient's LOS in the department (if he exceeds the median stay)
** Disposition - If the patient gets either Admitted or Transferred vs Other
